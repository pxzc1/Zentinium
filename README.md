## About
Zentinium is a desktop AI visualization platform designed to provide real-time insight into the internal structure and behavior of neural networks. It supports multiple AI models and enables interactive exploration of layers, activations, and inference processes through an intuitive visual interface.

The primary goal of Zentinium is to make neural networks transparent and interpretable by exposing their internal architecture and execution flow. Instead of treating models as black boxes, Zentinium allows users to observe how data propagates through layers, how neurons activate, and how decisions are made.

Zentinium is built for anyone who needs deeper visibility into AI systems, whether for debugging, learning, or analysis.
